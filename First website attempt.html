        <h1>Introduction to my first website</h1><hr />
        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>This is a 1st draft of making my own website from scratch.<br />
            I have attmpted to add aeverything that I have learnt thus far.<br />
            I have included the following:
            <ol>
                <li>Heading Elements</li>
                <li>Paragraph Elements</li>
                <li>Void Elements <ul>
                    <li>(br /)</li>
                    <li>(hr /)</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>List Elements</li>
                <li>Nesting & Indentation</li>
                <li>Anchor Elements</li>
                <li>Image Elements</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>There will hopefully be more to come as I learn to pick up the skills to<br />
        Enhance the website to make it look even better!</p>
