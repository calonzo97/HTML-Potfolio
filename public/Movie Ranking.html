<h1>The Best Movies According to Christian</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Rush Hour Trilogy</h3>
<p>By far my favourite movie series as I love the
comedy writing/acting and the two actors have very
good chemsitry on and off screen. Always puts me
in a good mood while watching it and it demonstrates
the importance of family and friendship</p>

<h3>Star Wars Series</h3>
<p>I love the story writing in this movie especially 
from movies 1-6. It put's you through an emotional
rollercoaster throughout and the action scenes are
to die for!</p>

<h3>Your Name Animated Movie</h3>
<p>I love anime hence I had to mention one of the best
if not then the best anime movie which is Your Name.
The story is truly compelling and I love the soundtrack.
The way they portray the characters in the film is just
perfect as it tells a story like no other. But the most
impressive thing about the film is defintely the animation.
